    "One could assume that there are 9! different possible game states for Tic Tac Toe. After there would be a winner, players would stop playing so we have to discard those states. Instead of the full 9! = 362,880 states we therefore only have 255,168 possible game states.\n",
    "\n",
    "131,184 (1st player)\n",
    "77,904 (2nd player)\n",
    "46,080 (tie)\n",
    "This might seem like a lot but for a Computer this is a joke. If we assume symmetries (discarding states already present by rotations or reflections) this changes to just about 26,830 possibilitiess.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 138 terminal positions after assuming symmetries.\n",

    "Tic Tac Toe is something called a zero-sum game. A game where the outcome always sums up to zero in the end. Furthermore this is a perfect information game where the game state is completely open to you. You know everything about it, no hidden cards or anything like that. Therefore you can play perfectly since no luck or unknown variables are involved. (Playing perfectly doesn’t mean you will win). For this purpose this means there will always be a tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "When every single one of us plays Tic Tac Toe it is easy to say what goes on in our minds:\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at the board and try to predict the future. We try to find the move that will be best for us and worst for our opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially the computer does the exact same thing. It has one important advantage though it can see further into the future (given enough computing power). We could make the computer look far enough so it could see every possible move. This is how the computer can play perfectly and this is how many AI’s related to abstract games (chess, connect four, …) are implemented. If the games are too complex the computer might not be able to compute everything, but we don’t have to worry about that yet."
